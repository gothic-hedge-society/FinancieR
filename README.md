Installation
------------

FinancieR has not been released to [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) yet. When it is, you'll be able to install the released version with:

``` r
install.packages("FinancieR")
```

For now, you can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sweetClyde/FinancieR")
```
